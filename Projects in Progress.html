        <td width="600">A group leader will be able to host a gaming tournament and invite anyone with a code. They can pick a specific game and brackets will be set up. All group members have to pay an equal fee to enter and all the money will enter a prize
          pool which will then be distributed among the rounds, with the final round having most of the money. Basically like a local esports tournament that anyone can host. Money will be paid through paypal. </td>
